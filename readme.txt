Adds lorem ipsum text via the [dns-ipsum] shortcode and a TinyMCE button 

== Description ==

The Due North Studios Lorem Ipsum generator allows you to use a shortcode to generate between 1 to 20 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text. This is a great plugin to have installed while developing a site, as lorem ipsum text can help you visualize how the page will look with text before you have any final content.

The plugin will allow you to use the [dns-ipsum] shortcode in the content area of posts, pages or custom content types. The plugin also adds a button to TinyMCE which allows you to easily add the shortcode to the content area.

== Installation ==

1. Download the ZIP from GitHub
2. Upload under Dashboard -> Plugins -> Add New -> Upload
