Adds lorem ipsum text via the [dns-ipsum] shortcode and a TinyMCE button 

== Description ==

The Due North Studios Lorem Ipsum generator allows you to use a shortcode to generate between 1 to 20 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text. This is a great plugin to have installed while developing a site, as lorem ipsum text can help you visualize how the page will look with text before you have any final content.

The plugin will allow you to use the [dns-ipsum] shortcode in the content area of posts, pages or custom content types. The plugin also adds a button to TinyMCE which allows you to easily add the shortcode to the content area.

HOW IT WORKS:

The plugin generates lorem ipsum text by loading an RSS feed (XML file) from the lipsum.com website. The plugin will request a specified amount and type (paragraphs, words or characters) of lorem ipsum text and display it on your post after it is published. The lorem ipsum XML is requested from lipsum.com using the SimpleXML simplexml_load_file function. In layman's terms, the plugin pulls lorem ipsum text generated by the lipsum.com website and then displays it on your website. If the lipsum.com website were unavailble (for example, down for maintenance), the plugin would not be able to create or display lorem ipsum text.

== Installation ==
